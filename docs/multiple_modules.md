# Multiple Modules
In some cases, it may be necessary to have multiple modules in a single Terraform repo.  For example, there are numerous related IAM modules required, some with heavy dependencies to each other.

When this condition is present, each of the individual modules should be placed into a `modules` directory at the root of the repo, and contain subfolders for each module.  For example, there are 3 modules required under the `aws-terraform-iam_resources` repository, `role`, `ssm_service_roles`, and `user_group`.  Those three modules are located at `module/role`, `module/ssm_service_roles`, and `module/user_group`.  In each module folder, examples of the module use should be present.  For example, the examples on the use of the `role` module should be placed at `module/role/examples`
