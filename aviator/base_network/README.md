# Base Network

## Description

This module sets up basic network components for an account in a specific region. Optionally it will setup a basic VPN gateway and VPC flow logs.

## Default Resources

By default only `vpc_name` is required to be set. Unless changed `aws_region` defaults to `us-west-2` and will need to be updated for other regions. `source` will also need to be declared depending on where the module lives. Given default settings the following resources are created:

* VPC Flow Logs
* 3 public/private subnets static CIDRs ranges are setup to be used for default cases
* Public/private subnets with the count related to custom_azs if defined or region AZs automatically calculated by Terraform otherwise
* NAT Gateways will be created in all public subnets
* EIPs will be created in all public subnets for NAT gateways to use
* Route Tables, including routes to NAT gateways if applicable
